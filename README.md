###What's this?
Default crack, paid lua script.

###Some debug tricks
Lua uses default hwid protection, but also has checks for enabled debugging applications, such as: http debugger, etc.

###Reason
The main reason for the crack is that the person does not understand anything and is trying to threaten with the old crack of my script =)
